## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Initial scaffolding: `#![cfg(target_os = "linux")]` crate that
  dlopens `libvdpau.so.1` via `libloading` on first use.
- `sys.rs` exposes opaque type aliases (`VdpDevice`, `VdpDecoder`,
  `VdpStatus`, `VdpFuncId`, `VdpGetProcAddress`) and a resolved
  `Vtable` covering the single bootstrap symbol VDPAU exports
  directly (`vdp_device_create_x11`); every other VDPAU entry is
  reached via the `VdpGetProcAddress` returned by device creation,
  to be wired up in Round 2.
- Process-wide `OnceLock<Result<Vtable, String>>` cache so the
  dlopen + dlsym round-trip happens at most once per process.
- Unified `register(&mut RuntimeContext)` entry point. Round 1: the
  function confirms the library loads and returns; no codec
  factories are wired up yet. If load fails (no libvdpau, no X
  display, etc.) the function logs and returns — the pure-Rust
  codec path remains the only resolution candidate.
- Standalone-friendly `registry` feature (default-on) gates the
  `oxideav-core` + `linkme` deps.
- README coverage roadmap and priority explanation.
- Smoke tests: `frameworks_load` and `vtable_resolves` confirm
  symbol resolution on Linux machines that have the VDPAU driver
  stack installed.
